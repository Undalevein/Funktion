## About Funktion

Funktion is a functional program language leveraging aspects of parametric math notation. Functions are defined as generators that are stepped through, according to a global or local time step. The time step varies over an interval from a starting to ending point, allowing several independently-running functions that interact at different points of the program. When a variable reacher or passes its course from start to finish, or is called at a premature destination, it will return the ordered list of every output from beginning to end. Functions can have their input values increment by any amount, and either ascend in value or descend in value, depending on the orientation of the bounds. 

The story behind this language begins in calculus II. I was introduced by Prof. Patrick Shanahan to the concept of parametrics, functions whose variables could be independently controlled by multiple discrete functions. I used what I had learned to expedite design of bespoke graphical components for freelance animations. This inspiration had led me down a rabbit hole of mathematical discovery, which culminated in the development of my current senior project, Parametrix, a functional animation programming suite leveraging parametric notation for quickly automating short animations. I had initially developed Funktion as a helpful way to make programming in this paradigm as quick and intuitive as possible, and although its syntax may be read by others as terse, it makes up for it with its brevity.
